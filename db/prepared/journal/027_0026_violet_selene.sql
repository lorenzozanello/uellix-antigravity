-- This wrapper exists so the journal row and the unit COMMIT TOGETHER. psql
-- -1 wraps the whole invocation in one transaction and \ir splices the unit
-- into it, so a crash at any point leaves BOTH or NEITHER. The unit is not
-- copied here — it is included, so this file cannot drift from it.

\set ON_ERROR_STOP on

-- THE REFUSAL IS A SERVER-SIDE ERROR, NOT \quit.
--
-- The first version ended the refusal branch with `\quit 1`. Reviewer B read
-- exec_command_quit() in psql's command.c and found it takes NO ARGUMENT: the
-- 1 is not an exit code, and psql terminates with status 0. Any orchestration
-- checking $? would have read a refused unit as a successful one — the ledger
-- would be honest and the shell around it would not.
--
-- RAISE inside the branch produces a real error, so ON_ERROR_STOP exits 3 and
-- the transaction rolls back. It changes nothing: the include is in the OTHER
-- branch and never runs.
